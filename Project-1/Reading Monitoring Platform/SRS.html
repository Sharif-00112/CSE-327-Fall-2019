	<h3 align="left">1.	Introduction</h3>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;1.1&emsp;Purpose</h4>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of product is to track how long a student reads a certain selection given by the instructor  
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;by tracking his eyes with AI.This srs describes the whole system of our software. We can know the  
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;proper duration of reading period. It will be very useful if someone sort those learning materials 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;based on levels of learning.
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;1.2&emsp;Document Conventions</h4>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;We have used some documentation in this project.These are: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Database</li>
          <li>Entity Relationship</li>
          <li>Application programming interface</li>
          <li>Software Requirements Specification</li>
	</ul>
		
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;1.3&emsp;Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The teacher and the user both use this project.This srs is intended for teachers who will evaluate this  
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;project. The user can use this system also.The rest of the srs mostly contains the system features 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;which is most pertinent for both the teachers and the users.Developers who can review project’s 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;more features to it. Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as  
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;some bugs are easier to find using a requirements document.End users of thisapplication who wish to 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;read about what this project can do it.
	 
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;1.4&emsp;Product Scope</h4>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the product which will used by teachers to check whether a student assigned to read a specific   
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;pdf or not and how long is the student spending in specific paragraphs on that pdf. It  is a tiny,  
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;flexible, hard-working tool to automate processing & organizing files and folders. There are a group   
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;of different files and folders on this project. It will give the teachers about information and feedback 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;with data of specific students. We can also organize our associations in profiles and automatically scan   
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;monitoredfolders at a defined time interval. We can use this product in other sectors.

	<h3 align="left">2.	Overall Description</h3>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.1&emsp;Product Perspective</h4>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;This is a totally new self constructed product. No other previous version was launched before.</p>

	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.2&emsp;Product Functions</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>&emsp;Teachers can create an account and open a class with a unique reference code.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Students can create an account.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Students can enroll under a teacher with the required code for a specific class of that teacher.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Students and teachers can sign in using their facebook, email, or phone number.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Teachers can upload pdf files to their specific classes.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Students can open and view the pdf uploaded by their teachers.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Teachers can check which student has spent how much time in reading a specific paragraph of
				<br>&emsp;a specific pdf.</li>
			<li>&emsp;Snaps will be taken of  the students in every 30 seconds so that teachers can monitor if the 
				<br>&emsp;reader is the real one.</li>
			</ul> 
	</p>

	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.3&emsp;User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
	<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;It is assumed that this product will be mainly used by students and teachers. However it might also
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;be used by data analysts of various companies. Students and teachers are more important user 
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;classes compared to the other users. There will be other classes like sign in, sign up etc. 
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.4&emsp;Operating Environment</h4>
	<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;This system will operate on android smart phones and on desktops. The android version of the smart
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;phones must be at least Kitkat 4.4.4 or more.
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.5&emsp;Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
	<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;In order to effectively use the web version of this system, the user's pc must have a built in webcam or
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;a webcam connected to their pc. Developers must have access to firebase since firebase is used for user
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;authentication. For developing android versions developers must know java and for the web version
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;a php framework. For communication protocol developers must be familiar with git and Bitbucket.
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;For using google and facebook API, developers need to be flexiable to that. 
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.6&emsp;User Documentation</h4>
	<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;A manual in the form of a use case diagram shall be provided with the software.
	</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;2.7&emsp;Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>

	<h3 align="left">5.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h3>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;5.1&emsp;Performance Requirements</h4>
	<p>&emsp;Mandatory: e.g. response time a valve to close</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The system is unusable</li>
		<li>Not mandatory: e.g. response time for a UI</li>
		<li>The system is usable but provides a non-optimal experience</li>
		<li>Searching for previous pdf need to be quicker</li>
		<li>Detecting the movement of face and ensure that it is not the still picture</li>
		<li>The time duration of reading will be calculated as faster</li>
		<li>The face cognizance API need to be faster and it will be able to detect the face and eyes movement
		<br>from different angles.</li>
		<li>It will turn the pages and slides smoothly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 align="left">&emsp;5.2&emsp;Safety Requirements</h4>
	<p>&emsp;The user need to be behold at the screen when it to work, when the user use the system for a long time it  
	<br>&emsp;will damage the eye sight of the user.To alleviate the risk of damaging eyes the user can use glasses or the 
	<br> &emsp;brightness and the color content will be perfectly optimized according to maintaining the best comfort
	<br> &emsp;spectrum turn for eyes.
	</p>

	<h4 align="left">&emsp;5.3&emsp;Security Requirements:</h4>
	<p>&emsp;The faster and sooner in the software development process it has to fix the security issues. Application 
	<br>&emsp;security tools that integrate into the application development environment can make this process and
	<br>&emsp;workflow simpler and more effective. These tools are also useful for compliance audits, since it can save
	<br>&emsp;time and the expense by catching problems before the auditors seen them.The user will be notified 
	<br>&emsp;prior to using the system that this is the sole purpose of taking the picture and the picture will 
	<br>&emsp;not be misused in any other way.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>The pdf screening quality need to good and acceptable for the user to read.</li>
		<li>There must be the backup of uploaded files on the system</li>
		<li>Performance level of the a student will only monitored by the teacher</li>
		<li>Enrollment of a student should must be ensure by the teacher</li>
		<li>Each student should have the privacy of informations</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>&emsp;5.4&emsp;Software Quality Attributes</h4>
	<p>&emsp;Well documentation for readability. The software will be classify into small part in development stage  
	<br>&emsp;for further adding feature. Upload pdf file and reading file are separate feature from each other for
	<br>&emsp; easy testing. It is based on multi-platform which increase its availability. Rest API make sure its 
	<br>&emsp;database flexibility. It is really a effective and secure software for educational purpose. In future 
	<br>&emsp;it can be also used for survey of product for marketing company.</p>

	<h4>&emsp;5.5&emsp;Business Rules</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
		<li>In Every failure case for login/upload file/classroom accessibility will be observed</li>
		<li>User can give the feedback for the system</li>
		<li>Application can an collect relevant data from the user to improve the whole performance of the system</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	

	<h3 align="left">6.	Others Requirements</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>&emsp;Users must change the initially assigned login password immediately after the first successful 
				<br>&emsp;login. Moreover, the initial should never be reused.</li>
			<li>&emsp;The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to other OS does not create any problem.
